<h1>Using Fuzzy Logic to dinamically choose adverstising banners of food displayed on a restautant's homepage</h1>



<h2> The problem </h2>

<p>To demosntrate the application of a fuzzy experth system, we will consider a problem of 
displaying advertising of the food menu options on a homepage of a restaurant website.</p>

<p>A restautant opens daily for breakfast, lunch and dinner. A customer who wants to see what is 
going on the menu look it up on the website. However, it has fixed gallery of advertisig, 
which consists of a Title for the dish, a picture and a description.</p>

<p>The problem is that everytime that the chef changes the menu, the general manager have to 
contact the IT guys, who then will change, which is awkward and expensive.</p>

<p>Because the rules a human uses to define weather and define time can be described using 
linguistic terms, such as hot and cold weather as well as lunch and dinner time, so the 
selection of dynamic banner displaying suggestions of meals on a website homepage 
according to weather, season and time of the day, is a good candidate for the application of 
fuzzy logic. </p>
